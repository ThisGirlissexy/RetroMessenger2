Create a temporary working directory.
Copy linux_build_librs.sh in it for a clean libretroshare build or you can just do every step (from the script) by yourself.

You should replace the libretroshare.pro file in libretroshare/src with one of the following :

Use libretroshare.pro for Release and libretroshared.pro for Debug
!!!Change the full path for the following macros: UPNPC_DIR, GPG_ERROR_DIR and GPGME_DIR

libretroshare.a will reside in libretroshare/src/lib.linux-g++
